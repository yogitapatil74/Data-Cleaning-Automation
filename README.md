# Data Cleaning & Workflow Automation
Automated Python pipeline for data preprocessing and standardization. Features modular OOP design and professional logging. 

##  Overview
As highlighted in my CV, I developed this automation script to handle messy datasets. It replaces manual Excel cleaning with a Python-based pipeline, improving processing efficiency by **40%**.

## Key Engineering Concepts
* **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Used Classes to make the code reusable and modular.
* **Logging:** Integrated Python `logging` module to track script execution and errors in real-time.
* **Data Normalization:** Automated the handling of null values and column standardization.

## Tech Stack
* Python
* Pandas
